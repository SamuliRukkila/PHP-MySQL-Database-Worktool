# PHP Database-program

This project was made with HTML5, CSS, Javascript and PHP.

## How to use

Go to `lib/database_class.php` and change `mysqli_connect()`-values according to your account
name and password.

## What is this

This program operates a bit like PHPMyAdmin. It's merely a training project
continued from PHP-course for self-learning.

## What can you do

You can modify or create new databases, add and delete tables, and modify
almost anything basic from a simple database. Program has an active alert system
which'll be shown in the top area for immediate reaction. For the bonus there's
mass-create databases -system!  

## Pictures from the program running

![Example picture 1](pictures/example1.png?raw=true "Example 1")
![Example picture 2](pictures/example2.png?raw=true "Example 2")

### NOTE

**I strongly advice to keep the program in `safe-mode`. Without it you
are able to do some serious damage to your databases!**
